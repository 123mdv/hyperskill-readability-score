# hyperskill-readability-score

This is a Java learning project from Hyperskill/JetBrains Academy, more details here: https://hyperskill.org/projects/39?goal=7

In this project, I implemented a program that calculates a readability score for a text provided by an input file. The user can select from 4 different calculation methods and the system returns the readability in terms of the school grade and age the text is suitable for.
